# mp3-fft

Work in progress.
Currently, everything is in the ipython notebook.
Program currently takes in a wav file, performs FFT on a randomly sampled chunk of the song, and compares 
sound frequencies in the song. Plots a lollipop graph for visualization

Use convert.py as necessary to get to WAV format.

Dependancies:
Ipython
SciPy
NumPy
MatPlotLib

ffmpeg/ffmpy if you need to convert to WAV.
